# Stars

### Hello👋
This is the code of colored stars❤️.<br>
We don't have anything in HTML.<br>
<hr>

### It's all in JavaScript.<br>
Random functions are used, which causes the position of the stars to change every time the page is refreshed.<br>
They get a random color and their time is also random.<br>

### That was all!
